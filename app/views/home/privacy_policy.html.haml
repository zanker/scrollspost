          Like most website operators, ScrollsPost collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ScrollsPost’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ScrollsPost’s visitors use its website. From time to time, ScrollsPost may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
          ScrollsPost also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. ScrollsPost only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

          Certain visitors to ScrollsPost’s websites choose to interact with ScrollsPost in ways that require ScrollsPost to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ScrollsPost gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask customers who create accounts for the purposes of obtaining a portfolio site to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with ScrollsPost – by purchasing subscriptions, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, ScrollsPost collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the customer’s interaction with ScrollsPost. ScrollsPost does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Customers can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

        %p
          ScrollsPost discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ScrollsPost’s behalf or to provide services available at ScrollsPost’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ScrollsPost’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ScrollsPost will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ScrollsPost discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when ScrollsPost believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ScrollsPost, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an ScrollsPost website and have supplied your email address, ScrollsPost may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with ScrollsPost and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ScrollsPost takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
