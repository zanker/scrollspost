About
===

This was a random side project for a pricing and card site on Scrolls automated through a bot that could login to the game.

As I don't have the time to maintain it anymore, I shut it down and am releasing the source for anyone who wants to look around. See LICENSE for licensing terms.

Note, that I do not provide any support or help with running this. I also do not distribute any of the fonts used for the cards (dwarvenaxe, dwarvenaxe italic, honeymead) as I don't have a distribution license on those.

Any usage of the old ScrollsPost name or logos is not allowed.
